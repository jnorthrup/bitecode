By contrast, the GNU&#xa;General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom&#xa;to share and change free software--to make sure the software&#xa;is free for all its users. This General Public License&#xa;applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&apos;s software&#xa;and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.&#xa;(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by&#xa;the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can&#xa;apply it to your programs, too.&#xa;&#xa;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xa;not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xa;sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xa;software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you&#xa;receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you&#xa;can change the software or use pieces of it in new free&#xa;programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xa;&#xa;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that&#xa;forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to&#xa;surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to&#xa;certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of&#xa;the software, or if you modify it.&#xa;&#xa;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,&#xa;whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients&#xa;all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,&#xa;too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show&#xa;them these terms so they know their rights.&#xa;&#xa;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the&#xa;software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you&#xa;legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the&#xa;software.&#xa;&#xa;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xa;certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty&#xa;for this free software. If the software is modified by&#xa;someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know&#xa;that what they have is not the original, so that any&#xa;problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xa;original authors&apos; reputations.&#xa;&#xa;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by&#xa;software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that&#xa;redistributors of a free program will individually obtain&#xa;patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.&#xa;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must&#xa;be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.&#xa;&#xa;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution&#xa;and modification follow.&#xa;&#xa;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND&#xa;MODIFICATION&#xa;&#xa;0. This License applies to any program or other work which&#xa;contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it&#xa;may be distributed under the terms of this General Public&#xa;License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or&#xa;work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the&#xa;Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is&#xa;to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#xa;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xa;another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included&#xa;without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each&#xa;licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xa;&#xa;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xa;are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&#xa;The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the&#xa;output from the Program is covered only if its contents&#xa;constitute a work based on the Program (independent of&#xa;having been made by running the Program). Whether that is&#xa;true depends on what the Program does.&#xa;&#xa;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xa;Program&apos;s source code as you receive it, in any medium,&#xa;provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on&#xa;each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of&#xa;warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this&#xa;License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any&#xa;other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along&#xa;with the Program.&#xa;&#xa;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xa;copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection&#xa;in exchange for a fee.&#xa;&#xa;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any&#xa;portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and&#xa;copy and distribute such modifications or work under the&#xa;terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of&#xa;these conditions:&#xa;&#xa;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent&#xa;    notices stating that you changed the files and the date&#xa;    of any change.&#xa;&#xa;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or&#xa;    publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived&#xa;    from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as&#xa;    a whole at no charge to all third parties under the&#xa;    terms of this License.&#xa;&#xa;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands&#xa;    interactively when run, you must cause it, when started&#xa;    running for such interactive use in the most ordinary&#xa;    way, to print or display an announcement including an&#xa;    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is&#xa;    no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a&#xa;    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program&#xa;    under these conditions, and telling the user how to view&#xa;    a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program&#xa;    itself is interactive but does not normally print such&#xa;    an announcement, your work based on the Program is not&#xa;    required to print an announcement.)&#xa;&#xa;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xa;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xa;Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xa;separate works in themselves, then this License, and its&#xa;terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute&#xa;them as separate works. But when you distribute the same&#xa;sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the&#xa;Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms&#xa;of this License, whose permissions for other licensees&#xa;extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part&#xa;regardless of who wrote it.&#xa;&#xa;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights&#xa;or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;&#xa;rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the&#xa;distribution of derivative or collective works based on the&#xa;Program.&#xa;&#xa;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on&#xa;the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the&#xa;Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium&#xa;does not bring the other work under the scope of this&#xa;License.&#xa;&#xa;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based&#xa;on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xa;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xa;also do one of the following:&#xa;&#xa;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding&#xa;    machine-readable source code, which must be distributed&#xa;    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xa;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xa;&#xa;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least&#xa;    three years, to give any third party, for a charge no&#xa;    more than your cost of physically performing source&#xa;    distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the&#xa;    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the&#xa;    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily&#xa;    used for software interchange; or,&#xa;&#xa;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to&#xa;    the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This&#xa;    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial&#xa;    distribution and only if you received the program in&#xa;    object code or executable form with such an offer, in&#xa;    accord with Subsection b above.)&#xa;&#xa;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the&#xa;work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,&#xa;complete source code means all the source code for all&#xa;modules it contains, plus any associated interface&#xa;definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xa;compilation and installation of the executable. However, as&#xa;a special exception, the source code distributed need not&#xa;include anything that is normally distributed (in either&#xa;source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,&#xa;kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the&#xa;executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xa;the executable.&#xa;&#xa;If distribution of executable or object code is made by&#xa;offering access to copy from a designated place, then&#xa;offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the&#xa;same place counts as distribution of the source code, even&#xa;though third parties are not compelled to copy the source&#xa;along with the object code.&#xa;&#xa;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the&#xa;Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any&#xa;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute&#xa;the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xa;rights under this License. However, parties who have&#xa;received copies, or rights, from you under this License will&#xa;not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xa;remain in full compliance.&#xa;&#xa;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you&#xa;have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you&#xa;permission to modify or distribute the Program or its&#xa;derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you&#xa;do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or&#xa;distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program),&#xa;you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xa;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or&#xa;modifying the Program or works based on it.&#xa;&#xa;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xa;on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a&#xa;license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or&#xa;modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.&#xa;You may not impose any further restrictions on the&#xa;recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are&#xa;not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#xa;this License.&#xa;&#xa;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xa;patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xa;patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by&#xa;court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the&#xa;conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the&#xa;conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as&#xa;to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xa;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a&#xa;consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For&#xa;example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free&#xa;redistribution of the Program by all those who receive&#xa;copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way&#xa;you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xa;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xa;&#xa;If any portion of this section is held invalid or&#xa;unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance&#xa;of the section is intended to apply and the section as a&#xa;whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xa;&#xa;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to&#xa;infringe any patents or other property right claims or to&#xa;contest validity of any such claims; this section has the&#xa;sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free&#xa;software distribution system, which is implemented by public&#xa;license practices. Many people have made generous&#xa;contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xa;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xa;that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or&#xa;she is willing to distribute software through any other&#xa;system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.&#xa;&#xa;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xa;believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xa;&#xa;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is&#xa;restricted in certain countries either by patents or by&#xa;copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who&#xa;places the Program under this License may add an explicit&#xa;geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xa;countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xa;among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this&#xa;License incorporates the limitation as if written in the&#xa;body of this License.&#xa;&#xa;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or&#xa;new versions of the General Public License from time to&#xa;time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the&#xa;present version, but may differ in detail to address new&#xa;problems or concerns.&#xa;&#xa;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If&#xa;the Program specifies a version number of this License which&#xa;applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option&#xa;of following the terms and conditions either of that version&#xa;or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xa;Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number&#xa;of this License, you may choose any version ever published&#xa;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xa;&#xa;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into&#xa;other free programs whose distribution conditions are&#xa;different, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xa;software which is copyrighted by the Free Software&#xa;Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xa;sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be&#xa;guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all&#xa;derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xa;sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xa;&#xa;NO WARRANTY&#xa;&#xa;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xa;NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xa;APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE&#xa;COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM&#xa;&quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xa;IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED&#xa;WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xa;PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE&#xa;OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE&#xa;DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&#xa;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xa;&#xa;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED&#xa;TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY&#xa;WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED&#xa;ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,&#xa;SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF&#xa;THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT&#xa;LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR&#xa;LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE&#xa;PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH&#xa;HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xa;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xa;&#xa;              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xa;&#xa;       How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xa;&#xa;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the&#xa;greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve&#xa;this is to make it free software which everyone can&#xa;redistribute and change under these terms.&#xa;&#xa;To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is&#xa;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to&#xa;most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each&#xa;file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer&#xa;to where the full notice is found.&#xa;&#xa;    One line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xa;    what it does. Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;&#xa;&#xa;    This program is free software; you can redistribute it&#xa;    and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General&#xa;    Public License as published by the Free Software&#xa;    Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your&#xa;    option) any later version.&#xa;&#xa;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be&#xa;    useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the&#xa;    implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A&#xa;    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License&#xa;    for more details.&#xa;&#xa;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General&#xa;    Public License along with this program; if not, write to&#xa;    the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place,&#xa;    Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA&#xa;&#xa;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xa;paper mail.&#xa;&#xa;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xa;like this when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xa;&#xa;    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of&#xa;    author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;&#xa;    for details type `show w&apos;.

Of&#xa;course, the commands you use may be called something other&#xa;than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could even be mouse-clicks&#xa;or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xa;&#xa;You should also get your employer (if you work as a&#xa;programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xa;disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample;&#xa;alter the names:&#xa;&#xa;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in&#xa;  the program `Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at&#xa;  compilers) written by James Hacker.&#xa;&#xa;  signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989&#xa;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xa;&#xa;This General Public License does not permit incorporating&#xa;your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a&#xa;subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to&#xa;permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If&#xa;this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General&#xa;Public License instead of this License.&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;&quot;CLASSPATH&quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2&#xa;&#xa;&#xa;Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.&#xa;are subject to the following clarification and special&#xa;exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Sun has expressly&#xa;included in the particular source file&apos;s header the words&#xa;&quot;Sun designates this particular file as subject to the&#xa;&quot;Classpath&quot; exception as provided by Sun in the License file&#xa;that accompanied this code.&quot;&#xa;&#xa;Linking this library statically or dynamically with other&#xa;modules is making a combined work based on this library.&#xa;Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public&#xa;License Version 2 cover the whole combination.&#xa;&#xa;As a special exception, the copyright holders of this&#xa;library give you permission to link this library with&#xa;independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of&#xa;the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy&#xa;and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your&#xa;choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked&#xa;independent module, the terms and conditions of the license&#xa;of that module. An independent module is a module which is&#xa;not derived from or based on this library. If you modify&#xa;this library, you may extend this exception to your version&#xa;of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you&#xa;do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from&#xa;your version.&#xa;&#xa;COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) Version 1.0&#xa;&#xa;1.

Contributor Grant.&#xa;&#xa;Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and&#xa;subject to third party intellectual property claims, each&#xa;Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,&#xa;non-exclusive license:&#xa;&#xa;(a) under intellectual property rights (other than&#xa;patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to&#xa;use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense&#xa;and distribute the Modifications created by such&#xa;Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an&#xa;unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as&#xa;Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and&#xa;&#xa;(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,&#xa;using, or selling of Modifications made by that&#xa;Contributor either alone and/or in combination with&#xa;its Contributor Version (or portions of such&#xa;combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,&#xa;have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)&#xa;Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions&#xa;thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications&#xa;made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version&#xa;(or portions of such combination).&#xa;&#xa;(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and&#xa;2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first&#xa;distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications&#xa;available to a third party.&#xa;&#xa;(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent&#xa;license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor&#xa;has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for&#xa;infringements caused by: (i) third party&#xa;modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the&#xa;combination of Modifications made by that Contributor&#xa;with other software (except as part of the&#xa;Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under&#xa;Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the&#xa;absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.&#xa;&#xa;3. Distribution Obligations.&#xa;&#xa;3.1. Availability of Source Code.&#xa;&#xa;Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make&#xa;available in Executable form must also be made available in&#xa;Source Code form and that Source Code form must be&#xa;distributed only under the terms of this License. You must&#xa;include a copy of this License with every copy of the&#xa;Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or&#xa;otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any&#xa;such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can&#xa;obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a&#xa;reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used&#xa;for software exchange.&#xa;&#xa;3.2. Modifications.&#xa;&#xa;The Modifications that You create or to which You&#xa;contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You&#xa;represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your&#xa;original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to&#xa;grant the rights conveyed by this License.&#xa;&#xa;3.3. Required Notices.&#xa;&#xa;You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications&#xa;that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.&#xa;You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or&#xa;trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or&#xa;any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving&#xa;attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.&#xa;&#xa;3.4. Application of Additional Terms.&#xa;&#xa;You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered&#xa;Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the&#xa;applicable version of this License or the recipients&apos;&#xa;rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a&#xa;fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability&#xa;obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.&#xa;However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on&#xa;behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You&#xa;must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,&#xa;support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by&#xa;You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial&#xa;Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred&#xa;by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of&#xa;warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.&#xa;&#xa;3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.&#xa;&#xa;You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered&#xa;Software under the terms of this License or under the terms&#xa;of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms&#xa;different from this License, provided that You are in&#xa;compliance with the terms of this License and that the&#xa;license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit&#xa;or alter the recipient&apos;s rights in the Source Code form&#xa;from the rights set forth in this License. If You&#xa;distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a&#xa;different license, You must make it absolutely clear that&#xa;any terms which differ from this License are offered by You&#xa;alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You&#xa;hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every&#xa;Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial&#xa;Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms&#xa;You offer.&#xa;&#xa;3.6. Larger Works.&#xa;&#xa;You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software&#xa;with other code not governed by the terms of this License&#xa;and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such&#xa;a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License&#xa;are fulfilled for the Covered Software.&#xa;&#xa;4. Versions of the License.&#xa;&#xa;4.1. New Versions.&#xa;&#xa;Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and&#xa;may publish revised and/or new versions of this License&#xa;from time to time. Each version will be given a&#xa;distinguishing version number. Except as provided in&#xa;Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the&#xa;right to modify this License.&#xa;&#xa;4.2. Effect of New Versions.&#xa;&#xa;You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise&#xa;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the&#xa;version of the License under which You originally received&#xa;the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a&#xa;notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being&#xa;distributed or otherwise made available under any&#xa;subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and&#xa;make the Covered Software available under the terms of the&#xa;version of the License under which You originally received&#xa;the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to&#xa;use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software&#xa;available under the terms of any subsequent version of the&#xa;License published by the license steward.&#xa;&#xa;4.3. Modified Versions.&#xa;&#xa;When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a&#xa;new license for Your Original Software, You may create and&#xa;use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename&#xa;the license and remove any references to the name of the&#xa;license steward (except to note that the license differs&#xa;from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that&#xa;the license contains terms which differ from this License.&#xa;&#xa;5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#xa;&#xa;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;&#xa;BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,&#xa;INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED&#xa;SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR&#xa;PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND&#xa;PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY&#xa;COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE&#xa;INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF&#xa;ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF&#xa;WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF&#xa;ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS&#xa;DISCLAIMER.&#xa;&#xa;6. TERMINATION.&#xa;&#xa;6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will&#xa;terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms&#xa;herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of&#xa;becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their&#xa;nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of&#xa;this License shall survive.&#xa;&#xa;6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding&#xa;declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or&#xa;a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against&#xa;whom You assert such claim is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)&#xa;alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the&#xa;Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor&#xa;or the Original Software where the Participant is the&#xa;Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any&#xa;patent, then any and all rights granted directly or&#xa;indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial&#xa;Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)&#xa;and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this&#xa;License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant&#xa;terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration&#xa;of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day&#xa;period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the&#xa;Participant Software against such Participant either&#xa;unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with&#xa;Participant.&#xa;&#xa;6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against&#xa;Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly&#xa;or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is&#xa;resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the&#xa;initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the&#xa;reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant&#xa;under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in&#xa;determining the amount or value of any payment or license.&#xa;&#xa;6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2&#xa;above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted&#xa;by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination&#xa;(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)&#xa;shall survive termination.&#xa;&#xa;7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#xa;&#xa;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT&#xa;(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE&#xa;INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF&#xa;COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE&#xa;LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR&#xa;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#xa;LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK&#xa;STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER&#xa;COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN&#xa;INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF&#xa;LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL&#xa;INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT&#xa;APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO&#xa;NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR&#xa;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT&#xa;APPLY TO YOU.&#xa;&#xa;8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#xa;&#xa;The Covered Software is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is&#xa;defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial&#xa;computer software&quot; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.&#xa;&#xac;&#xdf; 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &quot;commercial computer software&#xa;documentation&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.&#xa;1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1&#xa;through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users&#xa;acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.&#xa;This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,&#xa;any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses&#xa;Government rights in computer software under this License.&#xa;&#xa;9. MISCELLANEOUS.&#xa;&#xa;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject&#xa;matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be&#xa;unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the&#xa;extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be&#xa;governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice&#xa;contained within the Original Software (except to the extent&#xa;applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such&#xa;jurisdiction&apos;s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation&#xa;relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of&#xa;the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a&#xa;notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing&#xa;party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court&#xa;costs and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and expenses. The&#xa;application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the&#xa;International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or&#xa;regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall&#xa;be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.&#xa;You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the&#xa;United States export administration regulations (and the export&#xa;control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,&#xa;distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&#xa;&#xa;10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#xa;&#xa;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is&#xa;responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or&#xa;indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License&#xa;and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to&#xa;distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing&#xa;herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission&#xa;of liability.&#xa;&#xa;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND&#xa;DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)&#xa;&#xa;The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws&#xa;of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions).&#xa;Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the&#xa;jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of&#xa;California and the state courts of the State of California, with&#xa;venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.&#xa;"/>
