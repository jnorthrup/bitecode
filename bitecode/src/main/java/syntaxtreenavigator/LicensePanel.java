By contrast, the GNU\nGeneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\nto share and change free software--to make sure the software\nis free for all its users. This General Public License\napplies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software\nand to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\n(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can\napply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,\nnot price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make\nsure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free\nsoftware (and charge for this service if you wish), that you\nreceive source code or can get it if you want it, that you\ncan change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that\nforbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to\nsurrender the rights. These restrictions translate to\ncertain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of\nthe software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program,\nwhether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients\nall the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,\ntoo, receive or can get the source code. And you must show\nthem these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the\nsoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you\nlegal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the\nsoftware.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make\ncertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty\nfor this free software. If the software is modified by\nsomeone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know\nthat what they have is not the original, so that any\nproblems introduced by others will not reflect on the\noriginal authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by\nsoftware patents. We wish to avoid the danger that\nredistributors of a free program will individually obtain\npatent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\nand modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND\nMODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it\nmay be distributed under the terms of this General Public\nLicense. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or\nwork, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the\nProgram or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\nto say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into\nanother language. (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each\nlicensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification\nare not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.\nThe act of running the Program is not restricted, and the\noutput from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of\nhaving been made by running the Program). Whether that is\ntrue depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the\nProgram's source code as you receive it, in any medium,\nprovided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on\neach copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of\nwarranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and give any\nother recipients of the Program a copy of this License along\nwith the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a\ncopy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection\nin exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any\nportion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and\ncopy and distribute such modifications or work under the\nterms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent\n    notices stating that you changed the files and the date\n    of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or\n    publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived\n    from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as\n    a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\n    terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands\n    interactively when run, you must cause it, when started\n    running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\n    way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is\n    no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program\n    under these conditions, and telling the user how to view\n    a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program\n    itself is interactive but does not normally print such\n    an announcement, your work based on the Program is not\n    required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the\nProgram, and can be reasonably considered independent and\nseparate works in themselves, then this License, and its\nterms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\nthem as separate works. But when you distribute the same\nsections as part of a whole which is a work based on the\nProgram, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees\nextend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part\nregardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights\nor contest your rights to work written entirely by you;\nrather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the\ndistribution of derivative or collective works based on the\nProgram.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\nthe Program with the Program (or with a work based on the\nProgram) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium\ndoes not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based\non it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you\nalso do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code, which must be distributed\n    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least\n    three years, to give any third party, for a charge no\n    more than your cost of physically performing source\n    distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the\n    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily\n    used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to\n    the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This\n    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial\n    distribution and only if you received the program in\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n    accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the\nwork for making modifications to it. For an executable work,\ncomplete source code means all the source code for all\nmodules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the executable. However, as\na special exception, the source code distributed need not\ninclude anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler,\nkernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the\nexecutable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by\noffering access to copy from a designated place, then\noffering equivalent access to copy the source code from the\nsame place counts as distribution of the source code, even\nthough third parties are not compelled to copy the source\nalong with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\nProgram except as expressly provided under this License. Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute\nthe Program is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License. However, parties who have\nreceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will\nnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties\nremain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you\nhave not signed it. However, nothing else grants you\npermission to modify or distribute the Program or its\nderivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\ndistributing the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nyou indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or\nmodifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based\non the Program), the recipient automatically receives a\nlicense from the original licensor to copy, distribute or\nmodify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are\nnot responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of\npatent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to\npatent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by\ncourt order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as\nto satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For\nexample, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Program by all those who receive\ncopies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way\nyou could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or\nunenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance\nof the section is intended to apply and the section as a\nwhole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to\ninfringe any patents or other property right claims or to\ncontest validity of any such claims; this section has the\nsole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free\nsoftware distribution system, which is implemented by public\nlicense practices. Many people have made generous\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of\nthat system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or\nshe is willing to distribute software through any other\nsystem and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is\nbelieved to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is\nrestricted in certain countries either by patents or by\ncopyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who\nplaces the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or\namong countries not thus excluded. In such case, this\nLicense incorporates the limitation as if written in the\nbody of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or\nnew versions of the General Public License from time to\ntime. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the\npresent version, but may differ in detail to address new\nproblems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If\nthe Program specifies a version number of this License which\napplies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option\nof following the terms and conditions either of that version\nor of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number\nof this License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into\nother free programs whose distribution conditions are\ndifferent, write to the author to ask for permission. For\nsoftware which is copyrighted by the Free Software\nFoundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be\nguided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all\nderivatives of our free software and of promoting the\nsharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS\nNO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE\nCOPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM\n\"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\nOF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED\nTO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY\nWHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED\nABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF\nTHE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\nPROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH\nHOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n       How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the\ngreatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve\nthis is to make it free software which everyone can\nredistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to\nmost effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each\nfile should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer\nto where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of\n    what it does. Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it\n    and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General\n    Public License as published by the Free Software\n    Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\n    option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be\n    useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the\n    implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License\n    for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General\n    Public License along with this program; if not, write to\n    the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place,\n    Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and\npaper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice\nlike this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of\n    author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY;\n    for details type `show w'. This is free software, and\n    you are welcome to redistribute it under certain\n    conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show\nthe appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of\ncourse, the commands you use may be called something other\nthan `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks\nor menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a\nprogrammer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright\ndisclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample;\nalter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in\n  the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at\n  compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating\nyour program into proprietary programs. If your program is a\nsubroutine library, you may consider it more useful to\npermit linking proprietary applications with the library. If\nthis is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\n\n\nCertain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.\nare subject to the following clarification and special\nexception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Sun has expressly\nincluded in the particular source file's header the words\n\"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the\n\"Classpath\" exception as provided by Sun in the License file\nthat accompanied this code.\"\n\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other\nmodules is making a combined work based on this library.\nThus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public\nLicense Version 2 cover the whole combination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this\nlibrary give you permission to link this library with\nindependent modules to produce an executable, regardless of\nthe license terms of these independent modules, and to copy\nand distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\nchoice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\nindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license\nof that module. An independent module is a module which is\nnot derived from or based on this library. If you modify\nthis library, you may extend this exception to your version\nof the library, but you are not obligated to do so.
