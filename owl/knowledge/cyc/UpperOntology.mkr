            normal biological reproductive processes.  Your child is not\n
            an artifact.    If you do an oil painting of a house that is\n
            an artifact, but much more borderline is what you get if you\n
            take a rock and just paint it a solid color, say white.  In\n
            general that won&apos;t be an artifact unless it serves some\n
            purpose, such as marking the shoulder of a roadway, but more\n
            questionable cases are if the purpose of the white rock is\n
            just `to be sold as art&apos; or `to look pretty.&apos;  The\n
            white rock might thus be an artifact in certain contexts,\n

            artifacts (i.e., channel markers) as locations where ships\n
            may safely travel, the channel itself may have been a\n
            naturally occurring pre-existing thing -- e.g., the\n
            #$EnglishChannel.  If a #$ChannelOrStrait were produced or\n

            function-denoting   expression is appropriately combined\n
            with other expressions (i.e. the former  is in the 0th\n
            argument position and the latter are of the correct number\n
            and   type) the resulting expression is a new CycL term -- a\n
            NAT -- that may then   freely appear as a component in other\n
            CycL expressions.  The NAT will itself   denote the value\n
            (if any) of the function denoted by the former expression\n
            for   the sequence of arguments denoted, respectively, by\n
            the latter expressions.  For example, #$GovernmentFn is a\n
            unary denotational function, and so the  CycL constant\n
            &apos;#$GovernmentFn&apos; requires one (syntactic) argument\n
            (such as   the constant &apos;#$France&apos;) to form a NAT\n
            (in this case, the expression   &apos;(#$GovernmentFn\n
            #$France)&apos;).  This NAT, which denotes the government of\n
            France, can in turn serve as a (syntactic) argument in any\n
            CycL expression   in which (a term for) an instance of\n
            #$RegionalGovernment can occur.    Alternatively, we could\n
            have created a specific new term `GovernmentOfFrance&apos;,\n
            asserted that its denotation is an instance of\n
            #$RegionalGovernment, and so on.    But two related\n
            advantages to having NATs in CycL are that they (i) allow\n
            for   a drastic reduction in the total number of constant\n
            terms needed in the CycL   vocabulary and (ii) provide a\n
            convenient and systematic way to form appropriate   new\n
            terms as needed out of existing vocabulary (which terms can\n
            then inherit   from various existing rules and other\n
            assertions involving the terms&apos; component\n
            expressions).  &lt;PARAGRAPH&gt;  Important subcollections\n

            #$SetDenotingFunction, and   #$FunctionDenotingFunction\n
            (which is itself a subcollection of the first).    NATs\n
            formed using terms that denote instances of\n
            #$FunctionDenotingFunction   often denote instances of\n
            #$Function-Denotational themselves.  Thus, like most   other\n
            things, denotational functions can be denoted in CycL either\n
            by constants   (e.g. &apos;#$GovernmentFn&apos;) or --\n
            although this is less common -- by NATs (e.g.\n
            &apos;(#$FunctionToArg 2 #$biologicalMother)&apos;).  Note\n
            that the collection   #$Function-Denotational does _not_\n
            include all functions whatsoever.  Functions   that, given\n
            their natures and the nature of the CycL language, could not\n
            sensibly   be denoted by any NAT-forming CycL expression are\n
            not denotational functions.    Examples include certain\n

            (probably) any one-to-one function from the positive\n
            integers to the rational   numbers.  (For a more general\n

            has temporal extent and may have spatial extent and\n
            location, while a collection is timeless and abstract.\n
            Nonetheless, it is possible to define a collection parallel\n

            also instances (#$isa&apos;s) of the correlated collection;\n

            spatiotemporal thing, while the correlated collection (of my\n
            left toes) is NOT.  Another example: if I consider a certain\n
            flock of pigeons as having a location, a spatial extent, and\n
            a time of existence, then I am considering (the pigeon\n

            as the instances of #$FeelingAttributeType) such as\n
            #$Happiness and return as their value a certain-sized amount\n
            of that feeling; e.g., (#$LowAmountFn #$Happiness) is an\n
            expression whose value is a positive but small amount of\n
            happiness, and that in turn will be an element of\n

            make something true by stating it (e.g., ``I name this ship\n

            Commands in English typically have an (unexpressed)\n
            understood subject and perhaps a forceful tone.  In every\n

            five feet tall, and that she is `Tall enough to ride&apos;\n

            for explaining the differences.      Consider X, where\n
            (#$isa X #$Water). If we add some other substance(s) to X,\n
            to the point where the mixture acquires some salient\n
            characteristic(s) different from #$Water while retaining all\n
            the main properties, then we should assert\n
            (#$mainConstituent X W), where W is the original water --\n
            i.e., (#$isa W #$Water) -- and X is the whole new mixture of\n
            W with some other stuff(s).  Suppose we add enough enough\n
            other stuff that the physical properties of the mixture\n
            become significantly different from those of water; then we\n
            should assert only (#$constituents X W).      #$isa - Use\n
            #$isa if X would commonly be referred to as `water&apos;,\n
            including cases in which a small number of minor\n
            characteristics are different due to some admixture.\n
            Examples (arguably, 3 and 4 are borderline cases):     1. An\n
            instance of (#$PureFn #$Water) #$isa #$Water.    2. An\n
            instance of #$Water-Ingestible #$isa #$Water (but may have\n
            trace constituents).  3. An instance of #$PoolWater #$isa\n
            #$Water (but has some #$Chlorine as a salient\n
            #$constituents).   4. An instance of #$SeaWater #$isa\n
            #$Water (but has some #$Salt-NaCl as a salient\n
            #$constituents).        #$mainConstituent - Use\n
            #$mainConstituent when X contains other substances besides\n
            water, would NOT commonly referred to as `water&apos;, and\n
            yet has MOST of the material properties of water.  As a\n
            rule, most of the properties of the #$mainConstituent\n
            transfer to the substance it&apos;s a part of.  Often such\n
            substances have at least one important and/or perceptible\n
            characteristic (due to admixture) that is quite different\n
            from the properties of water.      Examples:     1. An\n
            instance of #$Lemonade is NOT called `water&apos; but has\n
            water as a #$mainConstituent.  It tastes quite different\n
            from water.  It has nutritional (caloric) value.  It is a\n
            human-made beverage.    2. An instance of #$Coffee-Beverage\n
            is NOT called `water&apos; but has water as a\n
            #$mainConstituent.  It tastes quite different from water.\n
            It contains caffeine.  Also, a specific inference about\n
            coffee&apos;s (lack of) transparency should override the\n
            transparency which would otherwise be inferred from the\n
            material properties of its #$mainConstituent.    3. Aqueous\n
            hydrochloric acid has many of the properties of its main\n
            constituent, water -- for example, transparency, viscosity,\n
            density, freezing point, etc.  But it also has the very\n
            important difference that it is highly acidic, caustic, etc.\n
            -- and attributing to it water&apos;s potability would be\n
            disastrous.    #$constituents - Use #$constituents when X is\n
            NOT commonly referred to as `water&apos; and has FEW\n
            properties of water, even though X contains water.\n
            Examples:    1. An instance of (#$SolidFn #$Gelatin) is NOT\n
            called `water&apos;, and though it has water among its\n
            #$constituents, gelatin has very few of the properties of\n
            water.   2. An instance of #$Concrete is NOT called\n
            `water&apos;; though it has water among its #$constituents,\n
            it has none of the salient characteristics of water.  3. An\n

            some common assumptions.  Thus each mt can be thought of as\n
            having two parts: a corpus of assertions that represent the\n
            `content&apos; of the mt, and a separate corpus of\n
            assertions that represent the `assumptions&apos; which are\n
            being made.  E.g., in a normal modern everyday life\n
            microtheory, there might be hundreds of content assertions\n
            such as `drivers are at least 16 years old&apos;, and there\n
            might be dozens of assumption assertions about that\n
            microtheory&apos;s content, such as `all actors are assumed\n
            to be law-abiding&apos;.   You can think of the assumptions\n
            as a set of extra conjuncts on the left hand side (the\n
            antecedent or `if&apos;-part) of every content assertion in\n
            the mt.      Each assertion in the knowledge base must be\n
            explicitly stated to be true in at least one mt.  It will\n
            then (by inference) also be true in all the more specialized\n
            contexts.  If something is true in the `life in North\n
            America&apos; mt, then it should by default be true in the\n
            `life in Canada&apos; mt.  I.e., the microtheories are\n
            organized into a generalization/specialization lattice by\n
            the predicate #$genlMt (q.v.), just as collections are\n
            organized into such a lattice by #$genls, and just as\n
            predicates are organized into such a lattice by #$genlPreds.\n
            Just as a collection may have several incommensurable\n
            supersets, so too a microtheory may have several\n
            incommensurable #$genlMts.  Just as each and every\n
            collection must have some explicitly recorded superset\n
            (except for #$Thing), each and every mt must have some\n
            (expicitly recorded) more general mt (except for the\n
            #$BaseKB, which is the most general context, containing\n
            universal, timeless truths).  Just as a Cyc concept may have\n
            multiple incommensurable sets of which it is an element (via\n
            #$isa), so too a Cyc assertion may be declared to be true in\n
            a set of incommensurable mts.    Every query is made in some\n
            mt, so the answer you get might very well depend on the mt\n
            in which you ask the question.  Let&apos;s call the current\n
            context C1, for the remainder of this paragraph.  The only\n
            assertions which can be used in C1 to answer the query are\n
            those assertions which were explicitly stated to be true in\n
            C1 or in some more general mt than C1.  But what if you want\n
            and need something like assertion P, to answer the question,\n
            but P doesn&apos;t fit that criterion, though P is true in\n
            some other mts that are unrelated to C1?  You can\n
            `import&apos; or `lift&apos; P into C1, by conjoining to its\n
            left hand side (if-part) the various assumptions of a\n
            context C999 in which P is known to be true.  I.e., what you\n
            actually conclude to be true in C1 is an assertion of the\n
            form `if a1 and a2 and... then P&apos;, where a1, a2,... are\n
            the assumptions of a context in which P holds (but which are\n
            NOT implied by assumptions of C1).  When there are several\n
            contexts to choose from, from which to import P, you will\n
            usually prefer the context whose assumptions are most\n
            similar to C1&apos;s assumptions, so there will be few extra\n
            conjuncts that need to be inserted in the `lifting&apos;\n
            process.    There is an implicit third component to each\n
            #$Microtheory, namely the Cyc terms which are `known\n
            about&apos; in that mt.  E.g., #$Lenat is not `known\n
            about&apos; in a microtheory set in prehistoric times;\n
            #$PhotochemicalEnergyTransduction is not `known about&apos;\n
            in a microtheory representing things that a toddler believes\n
            to be true; etc.  Unlike the content and the assumptions,\n
            however, there is no need to explicitly collect into one\n
            list all the terms which are `known about&apos;.  Rather,\n
            one could compute such a list by looking at all the terms\n
            which are mentioned anywhere in the content assertions of\n
            the mt.    Note that #$Microtheory is itself a `first-class\n
            object&apos;, as is each and every element of that\n
            collection --- e.g., #$CommercialBuyingMt,\n
            #$WorldGeographyMt, #$USHealthcareMt, #$HumanSocialLifeMt,\n
            etc.  The assertions about a #$Microtheory are just like any\n
            other Cyc assertions.      Note that one important predicate\n
            we haven&apos;t mentioned here yet is the one that says\n
            `assertion P is true in microtheory M&apos;.  That predicate\n
            is #$ist.  Thus:  (#$ist M P).    Note that another\n
            important predicate we haven&apos;t mentioned here yet is\n
            the one that says `microtheory M has the proposition P as a\n
            domain assumption&apos;.  Thus: (#$domainAssumptions M P).",

            represent significant differences in quantity, for the\n
            various types of measurable properties.  The most familiar\n
            case is for numbers, in which orders of magnitudes typically\n
            correspond with powers of 10; thus, in any given numerical\n
            quantity, the 100&apos;s dominate the 10&apos;s or the\n
            units, which are negligible with respect to the hundreds.\n
            In Cyc, we can identify the significant intervals for any\n
            measurable property.  For example, for #$Time-Quantity, some\n
            intervals which represent orders of magnitude are:\n
            #$AFewSecondsDuration, #$AFewMinutesDuration,\n

            #$AFewWeeksDuration, etc.  Similar scales could be\n
            identified for any measurable property.  Moreover, orders of\n
            magnitude for the same measurable property may differ\n
            between microtheories; e.g., the orders of magnitude for\n
            #$Time-Quantity in a `GeologicalTimeMt&apos; would be much\n
            larger than those listed above, which are relevant for human\n
            perceptions and activities.          Any two attributes\n
            which represent amounts of the same kind of property (e.g.,\n
            time, distance) and which are also elements of\n
            #$OrderOfMagnitudeInterval will be assumed to differ so\n

            associated with it) will be insignificant compared to the\n
            larger interval (and values associated with it).  That is,\n
            in general and as a default, if ORD1 and ORD2 are two\n
            different elements of #$OrderOfMagnitudeInterval which are\n
            also elements of the same type of #$AttributeValue (e.g.,\n
            #$Speed, #$Mass, #$Density), then one is negligible with\n
            respect to the other.  To know which dominates the other, we\n

            than the four mentioned above), which link is between which\n
            two nodes, and which point is on which link, and which node\n
            is on which loop, etc.  The rest should be determined by\n
            your set-up of the system.  For example, #$pathBetween can\n
            be used to specify the &apos;end points&apos; of each link,\n
            #$pointOnPath can be used to specify which point is on which\n
            link, #$pointOnCycle specifies which node is on which loop,\n
            and, when more points than the end-points of a link are\n
            desired to be on the link, #$betweenOnPath can be used to\n
            specify the relative positions of all points on a link.  But\n
            there are more convenient ways to set up your SYS.  For\n
            example, if you use #$linkBetweenInSystem which is a\n
            combination of other predicates, it will give you what you\n
            need when using #$linkInSystem, #$pathBetween,\n
            #$nodeInSystem, #$pointOnPath to setup your system (except\n
            that this will not give you those assertions about isolated\n
            nodes or points on a link between its end points).  See\n
            #$pointInSystem, #$nodeInSystem, #$linkInSystem,\n
            #$linkBetweenInSystem (an abbreviation), #$pathInSystem,\n
            #$pathBetweenInSystem (an abbreviation), #$pointOnPath,\n
            #$betweenOnPath, #$loopInSystem, #$pointOnCycle,\n
            #$junctionInSystem, #$deadEndInSystem,\n
            #$isolatedNodeInSystem and #$connectedInSystem.  Note that a\n
            path system may satisfy further condition in addition to\n
            those determined by the conditions on these predicates.  For\n
            example, links and loops may have &apos;directions&apos;.\n
            When further conditions are added to some path systems, we\n
            expect different kinds of path systems. For some particular\n
            kinds of path systems, see #$Semi-DirectedPathSystem,\n

            Our example #$genls has #$arity 2,  and both its #$arg1Isa\n

            create a new constant to refer to a set.  Instead, a set\n

            listing its elements, using #$TheSet, as in (#$TheSet 3 4\n
            5).  (In certain cases, a set will be extensionally\n

            both abstract entities, lacking spatial and temporal\n
            properties.  More specifically, they (can) have elements,\n
            and hence may stand to one another in set-theoretic\n
            relations such as #$subsetOf and #$disjointWith.\n
            Nevertheless, sets and collections differ in two important\n
            respects.  Every collection is associated with an\n
            intensional criterion for membership -- a more or less\n
            natural property or group of properties possessed by its\n
            members.  (The criterion for membership need not, and often\n
            will not, be precisely definable in any language.)\n
            Collections are thus akin to kinds.  In contrast, the\n
            elements of a set are not required to be homogeneous in any\n
            respect; any things whatsoever may together comprise the\n
            members of a set.  The second major difference between sets\n
            and collections is that no two distinct sets can be\n
            co-extensional (be such that every element of one is an\n
            element of the other and conversely).  Sets are, so to\n
            speak, identified on the basis of their extensions.\n
            Collections, on the other hand, are identified by their\n
            intensional criteria for membership.  So collections which\n
            have exactly the same elements may be distinct, differing in\n
            their respective membership criteria.",

            important concept, but one that is rarely given a name.\n
            There are many sets of sets for which any two member sets\n
            either will be disjoint (i.e., have no intersection) or else\n
            one will be a subset of the other.  For instance, consider\n
            the various types (i.e., sets) of animals in the usual\n
            Linnaean taxonomy:  Vertebrate, Bird, Dog, Mammal,\n
            Invertebrate, Person, etc.; Vertebrates and Invertebrates\n
            are mutually disjoint, while Bird, Mammal, Dog, and Person\n
            are all subsets of Vertebrate.  Dog and Person are disjoint\n
            with each other, but each of them is a subset of Vertebrate.\n
            All of the Linnaean sets, or collections, of animals can be\n
            grouped together into one set, or collection, of sets, which\n
            in turn is an instance of #$SiblingDisjointCollection.\n
            It turns out that the real situation --- and the real\n
            definition of #$SiblingDisjointCollection --- is slightly\n
            more complicated than that.  Consider types of appliances:\n
            toasters, cars, shavers, clocks, etc.  Is the set of such\n
            appliance-types a #$SiblingDisjointCollection, the way we\n
            defined it above, for types of animals?  Almost, but not\n
            quite.  One could have an appliance-type `ClockRadio&apos;,\n
            which would be the set of all clock radios, and clearly each\n
            clock radio is both a clock and a radio, yet neither #$Clock\n
            nor #$RadioReceiver is a subset of the other.  So if we have\n
            some item that purports to be both a clock and radio, that\n
            is okay if one of the following three conditions is met:\n
            (1) the collection #$Clock is known to be a subset of\n
            #$RadioReceiver;  (2) the collection #$RadioReceiver is\n
            known to be a subset of #$Clock;  (3) there is already\n
            defined a collection X which is a subset of both #$Clock and\n
            #$RadioReceiver.  More formally, the axiom that defines\n
            #$SiblingDisjointCollection is as follows: SIB is an element\n
            of #$SiblingDisjointCollection if and only if:  (#$implies\n
            (#$and          (#$isa C1 SIB)          (#$isa C2 SIB)\n
            (#$isa C1-EL C1)         (#$different C1 C2))     (#$or\n
            (#$not (#$isa C1-EL C2))          (#$thereExists C3 (#$and\n
            (#$genls C3 C2) (#$genls C3 C1) (#$isa C1-EL C3)))))  That\n
            axiom, together with the minimization of #$genls, gives us\n
            the following characterization of our concept:  If we have a\n
            collection SIB that is an element of\n
            #$SiblingDisjointCollection, and if we take two elements C1\n
            and C2 of that collection SIB, then each element of C1 which\n
            is not an element of a common specialization (C3) of C1 and\n
            C2, MUST NOT BE an element of C2.  In cases where there are\n
            a few exceptions --- that is, a couple of elements of SIB\n
            might have some overlap --- but it is undesirable to\n
            explicitly create a new reified constant (like\n
            `ClockRadio&apos;, above) for that intersection, Cyc allows\n
            you to use an explicit mechanism to override the\n
            #$SiblingDisjointCollection constraints for a particular C1\n
            and C2; namely, you would assert to Cyc\n
            (#$siblingDisjointExceptions C1 C2).  See also\n

            #$Breathing is a #$StuffType, since all #$timeSlices of an\n
            instance of #$Breathing are also instances of #$Breathing.\n
            Consider #$Water. Take any instance of #$Water -- say the\n

            true.  Note that (#$causes-PropProp p1 p2) is generally a\n
            more accurate way of talking about causation than saying\n
            that some event e1 causes event e2 (which one can do in Cyc,\n
            using the predicate #$causes-EventEvent) since often there\n
            are a few key aspects of e1 that cause a few key aspects of\n
            e2, and the remaining details of e1 and e2 were, to first\n
            order, irrelevant.  Note that, similarly, (#$causes-PropProp\n
            p1 p2) is generally a more accurate way of talking about\n
            causation than saying that some situation (see #$Situation)\n
            SIT caused something to be true (which one can do in Cyc,\n
            using the predicate #$causes-SitProp) since often there is\n
            some specific aspect of the situation that is the cause of\n
            the proposition&apos;s becoming satisfied.  Because this\n
            predicate is asymmetric and since effect (p2) can not\n
            temporally precede cause (p1), #$causes-PropProp may not be\n
            used to express mutual causation, e.g. feedback loops for\n
            which it may be said that two events (probably more\n
            process-like) cause each other.  We consider mutual\n
            causation to be a different form of causation and should be\n
            expressed using some as of yet (Dec 96) unreified\n

            M2 is slightly more complicated, namely: (#$forAll ?x\n

            associates RELATION with the FORMULA that defines it.  The\n
            arg2 is allowed to reference generic-argument keywords, such\n
            as :ARG1 :ARG2  which represent respectively the arg1 and\n
            the arg2 within uses of RELATION.  For example, (#$expansion\n
            #$genls (#$implies (#$isa ?object :ARG1) (#$isa ?object\n
            :ARG2))) indicates that the gaf (#$genls #$Poodle #$Dog) is\n
            defined as  (#$implies (#$isa ?object #$Poodle) (#$isa\n
            ?object #$Dog))).  Importantly, the expansion-formula arg2\n
            must be necessary and sufficient; it denotes the definition\n
            of the uses of relation arg1; there can be only one\n
            expansion for any relation.  Furthermore, no two relations\n
            can share a common expansion; thus, there can be only one\n
            possible contraction from a formula that corresponds to an\n
            expansion into a compact form that references expandable\n
            relations.  For example, (#$implies (#$isa ?object #$Poodle)\n
            (#$isa ?object #$Dog))) has the unambiguous contraction of\n
            (#$genls #$Poodle #$Dog).  The expansion arg2 can (and\n

            expansion of #$genls would be (#$or (#$isa ?object :ARG1)\n
            (#$not (#$isa ?object :ARG2)))).  No relation may reference\n

            &lt;PARAGRAPH&gt; Another negative example assertion\n
