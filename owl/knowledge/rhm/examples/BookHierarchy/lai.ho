//		What this book is;
/	Preface to the Paperback Edition;
//		p xv J. Barwise & J. Seligman, "Local Logics", in preparation;
/	1 Information;
//		1.1 What is information?;
//		1.2 A mathematical theory of information;
//		1.3 Logic ~= logic;
///			p6 situation/context dependence of language;
//		1.4 What is logic?;
///			p7 Oxford English Dictionary: Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference.;
///			p7 hitherto ruling doctrine: logic is the study of the properties of certain kinds of formal systems, and in particular the properties of the 'logical connectives' and (^), or (v), not (~), implies (->) and the 'quantifiers' for all (V), there exists (E), when used in conjunction with various finitary predicates and a collection of individual variables.;
///			p9 standard formal definition of logical implication (i.e. the material conditional) renders p -> q equivalent to ~p v q.;
///			p10 two sorts of major problem with classical logic: (1) total dependence on truth as the basic, underlying notion; (2) inadequacy of classical logic to capture ordinary, everyday, 'people logic'.;
//		1.5 The strategy;
///			p11 thought is not fundamentally linguistic, and I reject the necessity of positing some form of internal language (Mentalese) an an underpinning of mental activity.;
///			p11 information flow: situation  infon;
///			p11 infon may be thought of as a discrete item of information.;
///			p11 situation may be understood in its normal, everyday sense, to refer to some part of the activity of the world.;
///			p12 Information flow is made possible by certain constraints that link the various types of situation.;
///			p12 Constraints may be natural laws, conventions, analytic rules, linguistic rules, empirical, lawlike correspondences, or whatever.;
///			p12 agent is aware of, or attuned to, constraint;
///			p12 smoke means fire;
///			p12 situation(smoke) => situation(fire);
///			p12 FIRE means fire (linguist's convention that capital letters indicate the word itself, rather than its meaning);
///			p13 Misuse of constraints can result in the conveyance of misinformation.;
///			p13 Logic, in our sense, is the study of such constraints.  It may be regarded not as an alternative to classical, first-order, predicate logic, but as an extension of it.;
/	2 Information, Situations, and Infons;
//		2.1 The nature of information;
///			p14 different agents are capable of extracting different information from the same source (situation);
///			p15 the acquistion of information from a situation depends on those constraints of which the agent is aware, or to which the agent is attuned;
///			p16 nested information;
//		2.2 Cognition;
///			p17 the most basic kind of informational item: the possession or otherwise by an object s of a property P;
///			p17 Information received in analog form is always capable of yielding morre specific details.  Information received in digital form is not capable of such refinement.;
///			p18 perception: [analog] information in the environment becomes directly accessible to the agent by way of some form of sensor (seeing, feeling, smelling, hearing, etc.);
///			p18 cognition: extraction of specific [digital] item of information from that perceived 'continuum';
///			p19 Dretske: cognitive activity is fundamentally a matter of ignoring differences (as irrelevant to an underlying sameness);
///			p19 Dretske: there must be a digital-conversion unit;
///			p19 the process of cognition (at least an analog-digital conversion) involves a (often hugh) loss of information.  But there is a very definite gain, a classification of the perceived information.;
///			p19 the use of concepts to classify perceived (incoming) information makes such information available for (semantic) processing;
//		2.3 Schemes of individuation;
///			p20 Man sees objects as objects;
///			p20 agent carves up the world according to her purpose (and to some extent scale);
///			p21 individuals do not have to be atomic; individuals can have other individuals as components;
///			p22 infon: <<P,a1,...,an,i>>;
///			p22 i is polarity (truth value);
///			p22 infons are semantic objects, not syntactic representations;
///			p22 fact is infon that corresponds to the way things actually are in the world;
///			p22 each infon supplies a single item of digital information;
///			p22 Mathematical facts have a timeless, universal nature that most other informational items do not.  The majority of real life 'facts' pertain only to a certain region of space and a certain interval of time.;
///			p22-23 spatial and temporal locations may be either points or regions;
///			p24 t1 < t2 (precedes);
///			p24 t1 o t2, s1 o s2 (overlaps);
///			p24 some relations take other relations as arguments;
//		2.4 Situations;
///			p33 situation |= infon (supports);
///			p33 world |= fact;
//		2.5 Abstract situations;
///			p34 real situations are 'parts of the world';
///			p34 abstract situations are mathematical constructs: {infon | situation |= infon};
///			p35 for abstract situation: (situation |= infon) iff (infon in situation);
///			p35 not all abstract situations have any real counterpart;
///			p36 same is location-independent relation;
///			p36 coherent abstract situation: (i)no 'infon' is true and false; (ii)if a same b then a=b; (iii)for no a, (a same a) is false;
///			p36 incoherent abstract situations can play a significant role in analyzing how inconsistencies may arise in everyday use of language;
//		2.6 The nature of infons;
///			p37 what phenomenon in the world are infons intended to correspond to or represent?;
///			p39 representation can be measured, has unbounded information;
///			p39 information is something that results from the combination of the representation and the constraint;
///			p40 infons are equivalence classes of <representation,constraint>;
//		2.7 Number systems;
///			p42 abstract objects from our everyday experience;
///			p42 complex mathematical models;
//		2.8 So what exactly are infons?;
///			p45-58 infon is an intentional, abstract object which characterizes the constraints among situation types;
///			p45-48 infon is essentially dependent on the way the agent carves up the world into individuals, relations, and spatial and temporal locations;
/	3 Situation Theory;
//		3.1 Situations and situation-types;
///			p49 situation-types will be agent-relative;
///			p50 a careful development turns an apparently circular proposition into a genuine definition;
//		3.2 Types, parameters, and anchors;
///			p51 basic types;
////				TIM  a temporal location;
////				LOC  a spatial location;
////				IND  an individual;
////				RELn an n-place relation;
////				SIT  a situtation;
////				INF  an infon;
////				TYP  a type;
////				PAR  a parameter;
////				POL  a polarity ('truth values' 0 and 1);
///			p52 For each basic type T (other than PAR), I introduce an infinite collection T1,T2,T3,... of basic parameters, used to denote arbitrary objects of type T.;
///			p52 an anchor for a set, A, of basic parameters is a function defined on A, which assigns to each parameter Tn in A an object of type T.;
///			p54 an infon with an unanchored parameter is only a kind of 'template' for an item of information;
///			p55 the introduction of parameters into infons and types is similar to the formation of polynomials over a field;
///			p56 'nesting' of parameters and anchors for parameters ... clauses of a recursive definition;
///			p57 The appearance of the supports relation within an infon is, presumably, one that would normally be regarded as produced by the theorist's scheme.;
///			p58 a parameter 'carries with it' certain information in that it is constrained as to the sort of object to which it may be anchored. ... such 'information constrained indeterminates' are common in natural language.;
///			p59 Exactly what mathematical objects will be taken to represent types is not, at this stage, important. ... classes of objects being typed or 'canonical members' of those classes;
///			p60 Parameters act as 'variables' which are constrained with regard to what they may depict (i.e., the objects to which they may be anchored), whilst types are higher order uniformities given by a scheme of individuation.;
///			p61 it is only when the grounding situation is 'the world' (or some other suitably large situation) that parameters can give rise to types in the fashion described.;
///			p61 resource situations illustrate the difference between parameters and types;
///			p62 proposition x:T indicates that object x is of type T;
///			p63 the (basic) relations of an informational theory are fixed by the agent or species of agent;
///			p63 an infonic proposition is a claim of the form s |= I, where s isa a situation and I is a finite set of infons;
///			p64 types are taken to be uniformities that arise by means of a process of abstraction across parametric infonic propositions;
//		3.3 The nature of the ontology;
///			p65 mathematics is nothing more than a highly structured, syntactic 'game' played according to specific rules;
///			p66 just why is it that the mathematician's 'formal game' invariably turns out to be extremely useful in everyday life?;
///			p67 axiomatization invariably came some time after the main ideas of ther theory were worked out;
///			p68 the human mind is only capable of mathematical reasoning in terms of the mental 'manipulation' of abstract objects;
///			p70 situations are abstract objects introduced so that we can handle issues of context, background, and so on;
///			p71 our theory can be viewed as a study of how agents can acquire more information about particular situations;
///			p72 equality   s1 = s2  iff forall(i)[s1 |= i <=> s2 |= i];
///			p72 is part of s1 <= s2 iff forall(i)[s1 |= i  => s2 |= i];
//		3.4 Learning to live with abstraction;
///			p75 first danger: modeling can obscure the fact that a genuinely new collection of abstract objects is involved;
///			p75 second danger: it is often difficult to distinguish properties of the thing being modeled from properties of the model;
//		3.5 Oracles;
///			p79 for a particular set of issues G, a G-infon is any infon that results from anchoring the parameters in an infon in G;
///			p79 Given an individual (animate or inanimate) or a situation a, the G-oracle of a, OracleG(a), is the situation comprising that part of the world and the entire 'body of knowledge' that, within the framework provided by G, concerns a.;
///			p79 i.e., OracleG(a) is the 'minimal' solution, s, such that s |= i for any factual, parameter-free G-infon, i, that 'genuinely' involves a.;
///			p83 linguistic communication can be considered as the transmission of information about various situations;
///			p83 the more information a speaker and listener share about an oracle situation, the more efficient the communication between them;
///			p84 oracle situations are a situation-theoretic analogue of the irrational numbers: idealized objects about which we can acquire arbitrarily large finite amounts of information (infons), but which cannot in general be uniquely specified in such a fashion.;
///			p84 a particular oracle can only be identified in terms of a higher order description, namely as OracleG(a) for some object a, a definition that has no meaning on the level of infons;
///			p85 Oracles make no sense if you try to pin them down in terms of which infons they support.;
/	4 Meaning and Constraints;
//		4.1 Situation semantics;
///			p 86 ... the most significant aspect of language ... is the conveyance of information.;
///			p 86 The utterance of an assertive sentence will be referred to as a statement.;
///			p 86 ... the most basic questions to be answered are:;
////				What is the propositional content of a given statement, i.e., what claim does it make?;
////				What is the meaning of the sentence uttered?;
///			p 90 meaning is a relation between syntactic objects (words, phrases,;
sentences, etc.), the utterance situation type, and the described situation type;
//		4.2 Meaning;
///			p 91 nomic constraint - corresponding to some natural law;
///			p 92 reflexive constraint - more info. about the same situation;
///			p 92 necessary constraint - stems directly from the scheme of individuation;
///			p 93 conventional constraint - observed throughout the given linguistic community;
//		4.3 Meaning and information;
///			p 94 constraint C = [S => S'] gives rise to information flow;
///			p 97 parameter-free infons are the basic items of info. about the world;
///			p 97 (parametric) infons are the basic units of info. flow;
///			p 98 Our theory treats information as propositional.  s |= i where s is;
a situation and i is a parameter-free infon.;
//		4.4 Attunement to constraints;
///			p 99 type of mental situation '#S';
///			p 100 factual constraint '#S' => S;
///			p 100 attunement to, or awareness of, or knowledge of, a constraint C = [S => S'];
///			p 101 basic fact of the world S => S';
//		4.5 A simple robot;
///			p 102 SID - state register W, motion control register M;
///			p 104 endown registers with external significance (meaning) by connecting input to W and output to M;
///			p 104 SID becomes capable of 'intelligent' (in terms of its environment and allotted task) behavior only when we connect W and M;
///			p 106 fallacy of misplaced information (Barwise and Perry) - identifying 'information possessed' with syntactic items in a database;
///			p 106 a finite agent can possess an infinite amount of information, but can only know a finite amount;
///			p 108 outside of mathematics, it is in fact very rare to encounter a constraint that obtains universally, at all times and locations, and under all circumstances;
///			p 109 it is in general extremely difficult, if not impossible, to specify with any degree of certainty or exactitude just what are the background conditions under which a given constraint obtains;
///			p 109 C = [S => S']/B indicates that C is the constraint S involves S', the constraint being dependent on the background conditions in B being met;
/	5 Some Logical Issues;
//			p 111 how may two related infons be combined to yield a third infon?;
//		5.1 The standpoint;
///			p 112 cognitive agents identify entities, spatial and temporal locations, properties, situations;
//		5.2 Properties and relations;
///			p 115 every relation has a fixed number of arguments; a minimum number must be filled for a well-defined infon;
///			p 117 role ~> a denotes that the object 'a' fills the argument role 'role';
///			p 118 Thus the very definition of 'infon' distinguishes between falsity and nonsensity, in that the filling of argument roles with inappropriate objects is completely ruled out.;
///			p 121 just which argument roles must be filled, in order to result in a well-defined infon, is very much dependent on the relation;
///			p 123 Non-parametric infons, or 'states of affairs', are the basic items of information about the world; parametric infons are the basic units our theory uses in order to study the transmission of information.;
///			p 125 parameters and argument roles are quite distinct notions. argument roles are 'slots' in relations that may be filled with either objects or parameters. parameters are 'representatives' for objects, which capture informational linkages between situations. unfilled argument slots are unconsidered features of a relation, and do not contribute to information flow. all parameters in an infon must be anchored to supply information about the world.;
//		5.3 Persistence;
///			p 126 infon I has persistence if s |= I implies s' |= I;
for any situation s' that extends s;
///			p 127 the relations 'alone', 'present' must include a location argument to produce a well-formed infon;
//		5.4 Agent logic versus theorist's logic;
///			p 128 what we are calling 'agent logic' is just that logic that we, as theorists, attribute to that agent in order to provide an account (from the outside) of its information processing mechanisms.  the 'internal logic' actually employed by the agent may be different. 'internal logic' and 'agent logic' must both be consistent with the way the world is.;
//		5.5 Infon logic;
///			p 132 compound infons are not infons;
///			p 132 conjunction s |= I1 ^ I2;
///			p 132 disjunction s |= I1 v I2;
///			p 133 A disjunctive compound, I1 v I2,  provides information that restricts the way the world is, but does not provide the specific, concrete information about the world that a single infon does.;
///			p 134 existential quantification s |= (exists x in u) I;
///			p 134 universal quantification s |= (forall x in u) I;
///			p 136 no 'negation operator' on infons. polarity of an infon handles the one aspect of negation that makes sense.;
//		5.6 Types and propositions;
///			p 136 all propositions are essentially of the form <situation> |= <infon>;
///			p 138 types are uniformities of a higher order than individuals, locations, and situations.  a type is an intentional object.;
///			p 140 propositions are 'true' or 'false'; infons are not.;
///			p 140 Type abstraction corresponds to the human cognitive process of abstracting a 'type' from a given property.;
///			p 141 types are uniformities across propositions. infons are the basic items of 'structural' information about situations in the world.;
//		5.7 Two points of information;
///			p 142 an 'item of information' has two distinct meanings: (1) basic infonic proposition s |= I; (2) parameter-free infon I;
///			p 142 distinction between internal information provided by situation type, and info. provided by constraints between situations;
/	6 Mental States;
//		6.1 Cognition;
///			p 145 Winograd and Flores, "Understanding Computers and Cognition";
///			p 146 philosopher Martin Heidegger: Dasein (being-in-the-world);
///			p 147 bologist Humberto Maturana: autopoietic system;
///			p 150 basic metaphysical standpoint of this book;
///			p 150 cognitive activity is the manipulation and utilization of infon-information by an agent, for the purpose of guiding behavior;
///			p 150 cognition is the process whereby the agent acquires information by some perceptual means;
///			p 151 the agent scheme of individuation (identification) carves up the world into various uniformities;
///			p 151 digitization is the essence of cognitive activity;
//		6.2 Intentionality;
///			p 155 intentional mental states are realized as concrete structures in the brain, at a higher level than the molecular or neuron-synapse;
///			p 155 Intentionality is that property whereby mental states can be directed at or about or of objects or states of affairs in the world.;
//		6.3 Belief;
///			p 156 external content of belief - proposition about the world;
///			p 157 ungrounded belief - no external content;
///			p 157 Kripke example - Londres is pretty; London is not pretty;
///			p 162 notion is concrete structure realized in the brain. notions arise as a result of perception, communication from another agent, or combinations (("identification")) 'notion#';
///			p 162 empty notion - no corresponding uniformity in the world (("nonexistent"));
///			p 164 perception of an object is always perception of some aspect of that object. can be mistaken;
///			p 167 basic relation 'of' (("means"));
///			p 167 The belief situation associated with a particular belief captures everything there is concerning that belief, its structure, the denotations of the various notions involved, and the external content of the belief.;
///			p 170 belief report: de dicto, de re;
//		6.4 Other mental states;
///			p 171 most 'basic' intentional states: belief, desire, intention;
///			p 171 all other intentional states can be regarded as refinements of modal combinations of these three, using modal operator <> ('it is possible that');
///			p 171 fear that p = believe(<>p) ^ desire(~p);
///			p 171 sorrow that p = believe(p) ^ desire(~p);
///			p 171 hope that p = ~believe(p) ^ ~believe(~p) ^ believe(<>p) ^ desire(p);
///			p 173 for a basic mental state to be grounded, it is necessary that it involves no empty notions;
///			p 174 definite notion <D,ndot,T> - unique entity of type T;
///			p 174 indefinite notion <I,ndot,T> - arbitrary, or generic entity of type T;
///			p 177 characteristic features of beliefs: the way the agent takes the world to be; may be achieved; tend to persist until overthrown; may be held unconsciously; may simultaneously hold more than one belief.;
///			p 179 characteristic features of desires: the way the agent would like the world to be; agent may form intentions to satisfy desires; desires may conflict with beliefs; may be held unconsciously; may simultaneously have more than one desire; tend to persist, but can be dropped without any external stimulus.;
///			p 179 notions, beliefs, desires, etc. are situations - a certain neural configuration - a brain in a certain state;
///			p 181 a type of world situation is used to specify a type of mental situation;
///			p 181 external contents of intentional mental states = objects in the public domain = 'claims made about the world or some part thereof';
///			p 181 propositions are uniformities across intentional mental states;
//		6.5 Knowledge;
///			p 181 agent can only know propositions that are true;
///			p 183 knows is a relation, not an intentional mental state;
///			p 183 Knows(a,p,t) - agent a knows that proposition p at time t;
///			p 183 Knows(a,p,t) iff at time t agent a has belief B whose external conttent is proposition p, and B was either caused by, or causally sustained by, a acquiring the information that p at some time t' prior to t.;
///			p 183 a mental state B is causally sustained by an event E if E is sufficient to cause B. i.e., E1 causes B, but E2 would have caused B if E1 had not occurred first.;
///			p 184 take as fundamental the relation of one event causing another;
///			p 184 s1 |> s2 indicates that situation s1 causes situation s2;
///			p 184 the species of agent determines what constitutes a situation, but the world determines whether a situation causes another situation;
///			p 185 agent knowing (or believing) that she knows p involves the agent acquiring knowledge about (the reliability of) the evidence upon which the belief was formed;
///			p 186 a person might have all the information some of the time, but no one can know all the information at any time;
/	7 Perception and Action;
//		7.1 Visual perception;
///			p 187 Miller 'Rule of Seven': the largest number of individual items that can be directly recognized without counting is seven (unless items are arranged in some special way);
///			p 188 humans perceive more info. than they can digitalize; retain visual image for about 150 msec;
///			p 188 what we see are situations and individuals in those situations;
///			p 189 cognitive seeing is a higher-order, intentional activity of the brain ... produces a change in the brain state ... an intentional mental event;
///			p 192 brief comparison between visual experiences and (grounded) beliefs;
///			p 193 most visual experiences involve seeing of a wide variety of things;
///			p 195 seeing involves an experience of that seeings ... seeing is inherently circular;
///			p 195 a visual experience is directly cause by (what is going on in) the visual scene;
///			p 197 seeing is analogous to knowing ... both are facts of the world;
//		7.2 Seeing and seeing that;
///			p 200 sees vs. sees that vs. concludes;
//		7.3 Seeing and the network;
///			p 201 what you 'see that' depends on what you believe, what you know, (at a more fundamental level) your scheme of individuation;
///			p 202 Since anything seen is of necessity seen purely as an aspect, the agent's beliefs about what is seen also play a role.;
//		7.4 Logic of belief, desire, and perception;
///			p 203-207 classical logic often does not apply, e.g. beliefs can be contradictory;
///			Veridicality (truth);
///			Conjunction;
///			Disjunction;
///			Negation;
///			Existential generalization;
///			Instantiation;
///			Substitution;
///			Logical equivalence;
//		7.5 Intention and action;
///			p 207 future-directed intention (prior intention);
///			p 208 present-directed intention (intention-in-action);
///			p 208 like perception, action involves causal self-reference;
///			p 209 action is a composite of an intention-in-action and a corresponding movement or act. There is no such thing as an 'unintentional action', though there can be unintentional movment or acts.;
//		7.6 Intention;
///			p 210 Desire and belief can provide a reason to act a certain way, but they do not commit to that action as does intention. Desires merely influence action; intentions tend to control action.;
///			p 210 Belief, desire, intention, and the like, are fundamental mental states, and simplistic explanatory descriptions are the best that can be hoped for;
///			p 212 intentions constrain the agent's other beliefs and intentions;
///			p 212 intentions form parts of plans ... an agent's having a plan entails a commitment to follow that plan;
///			p 215 Unlike desires, intentions must be consistent.;
///			p 215 intentions create a framework of rationality within which the agent can formulate and follow further plans;
/	8 Situation Semantics;
//			p 216 people use language to do many things: convey information; ask questions; give commands; express emotion; provide comfort; evoke mental pictures or laughter or feelings of joy, sorrow, admiration; etc.;
//			p 217 situation semantics excludes syntax; it includes semantics and some pragmatics;
//		8.1 Language as action;
//		8.2 Speech acts;
///			assertives - true statements;
///			directives - commands & questions;
///			commisives - commit to future course of action;
///			expressives - psychological state;
///			declarators - qualified person makes it so;
///			p 218 most significant features of language use: utterance situation; speaker's connections; discourse situation; embedding situation; impact on embedding situation; resource situation; described situation;
//		8.3 Meaning;
///			p 222 abstract meaning (context-free) link between utterance situation type and described situation type;
///			p 222 meaning-in-use link between utterance situation and denoted proposition or object in the world;
///			The meaning of 'I';
///			The meaning of 'YOU';
///			The meaning of 'HE', 'SHE', 'IT';
///			The meaning of proper names;
///			The meaning of nouns;
///			The meaning of verbs;
///			Speaker's connections;
///			Speaker's connections and tensed verbs;
///			The meaning of singular noun phrases;
///			The principle of compositionality;
///			Sentence meaning;
///			Attributive uses of definite and indefinite descriptions;
//		8.4 Impact;
///			p 242 the impact of an utterance is the (relevant) change in the embedding situation that the utterance brings about;
//		8.5 Meaning and the Searle Classification;
///			p 247 expressive 'I am X';
///			p 248 directive 'do X';
///			p 248 commisive 'I will X';
///			p 249 declarator 'I declare X';
//		8.6 Compositionality;
///			p 250 conjunction and;
///			p 251 disjunction or;
///			p 251 contrast but;
///			p 251 informationally no distinction between 'and', 'but'. distinction lies in the intention of the speaker and the resulting impact of the utterance.;
/	9 Topics in Situation Semantics;
//		9.1 Quantification;
///			p 252 One of the most significant uses of parameters in situation theory arises in the semantics of natural language quantification.;
///			p 256 regard quantifiers as relations between types;
///			p 256 <<all,u,S,T,l,t,1>> all objects in u of type S are of type T (at location l and time t);
///			p 256 <<exists,u,S,T,l,t,1>> there is an object in u of type S that is of type T (at location l and time t);
///			p 257 The minimality conditions for quantification relations require that, in order to yield an infon, the arguments for the bounding set or situation and for the two types must be filled, but the time and place arguments need not be.;
///			p 260 our new framework explicitly incorporates the requisite background information source for each quantifier into the quantifier infon.;
///			p 260 all quatifications are necessarily made with reference to some domain;
//		9.2 Negation;
///			p 261 it is up to the speaker to fix the described situation;
///			p 264 no real difference between positive and negative assertions, but negative assertions require more emphasis on the specification of the described situation;
///			p 265 a cooperative use of a negative utterance places on the speaker an obligation to ensure that the described situation as understood by the listener is sufficiently rich to decide (the truth of) the relevant issue;
//		9.3 Conditionals;
///			p 269 counterfactuals - antecedent is false;
///			p 270 material conditional - contigent prohibition of future events;
///			p 275 alternative approach - an utterance of any 'if-then' statement is taken to refer to a constraint;
///			p 275 Human beings are planning creatures. They form plans or intentions as to their future courses of actions. And part of this plan-formation process will involve establishing personal constraints that govern their own action in accordance with their own desires and intentions.;
///			p 276 the constraint-based approach is the right way to handle conditionals, counterfactual or indicative;
//		9.4 Speaker's intentions;
///			p 281 it is only relative to a constraint that a particular signal (word, phrase, or sentence of natural language) carries information;
///			p 282 three features of natural language: propositional content; impact; speaker's intentions;
///			p 284 use of speaker's intentions to capture distinctions that are essentially a matter of emphasis, e.g. 'and' vs. 'but';

///			p 287 Liar sentence: This proposition is false.;
///			p 288 Theorem 1: The described situation in an utterance of the Liar sentence cannot be the world.;
///			p 288 Theorem 2: Any utterance of the Liar sentence expresses a false proposition.;
///			p 288 Theorem 3: w is not a situation. This is analogous to the result in set theory that the class of all sets is not a set.;
///			p 289 All uses of the situation w simply required that the situation concerned was big enough to include everything of relevance. ... this is never literally everything;
///			p 289 Rather what we need will be 'local worlds', objects (situations) that encompass everything of relevance to the activities of a particular agent of species of agent. Such situations might even have as spatial extent the entire physical universe and duration the entire time-span of the universe, and hence include all physical matter, but they will never include everything there is, all the facts, causalities, and what-have-you.;
///			p 290 exploitation of contextual factors to load simple symbol structures with large amounts of information;
///			p 290 The reliance on context in a communicative act places on the speaker a considerable obligation to ensure that the listener is aware of the relevant features of that context. Otherwise communication fails.;
///			p 290 None of this is a rule, notice; just a set of conventions to ensure that efficient communication may take place.;
///			p 290 an utterance of the Liar sentence made in accordance with the normal conventions will not produce a meaningful proposition. This is not a paradox, just a reminder that natural language consists of a huge balancing act with enormous degrees of freedom.;
///			p 291 Bertrand Russell sentence: The barber shaves all and only those who do not shave themselves.;
///			p 292 four forms of ambiguity in natural language: (1)the listener is not able to identify correctly the described situation; (2)misinformation from people or machines making mistakes; (3)ambiguous word; (4)ambiguous pronoun reference;
///			p 294 Chomsky's famous example of ambiguous words: (1)Time flies like an arrow. (2)Fruit flies like a banana.;

///			p 295 mathematics is the study of patterns;
///			p 295 situation theory is the scientific study of the relevant abstract patterns of meaning and information;
//		10.2 A new logic?;
///			p 297 First-order logic provides useful models of mathematical proof, but it does not correspond to the way people reason;
//		10.3 What next?;
///			p 297 long process of identifying the right features and constructing mathematical models;
///			p 298 So what is next? I really don't know. That is the nature of research, what makes it at the same time immense fun and intensely frustrating.;
