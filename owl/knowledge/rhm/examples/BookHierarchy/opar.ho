Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand;

/    1: Reality;
//        existence, consciousness, and identity as the basic axioms;
//        causality as a corollary of identity;
//        existence as possessing primacy over consciousness;
//        the metaphysically given as absolute;
//        idealism and materialism as the rejection of basic axioms;
/    2: Sense Perception and Volition;
//        the senses as necessarily valid;
//        sensory qualities as real;
//        consciousness as possessing identity;
//        the perceptual level as the given;
//        the primary choice as the choice to focus or not;
//        human actions, mental and physical, as both caused and free;
//        volition as axiomatic;
/    3: Concept-formation;
//        differentiation and integration as the means to a unit-perspective;
//        concept-formation as a mathematical process;
//        concepts of consciousness as involving measurement-omission;
//        definition as the final step in concept-formation;
//        concepts as devices to achieve unit-economy;
/    4: Objectivity;
//        concepts as objective;
//        objectivity as volitional adherence to reality by the method of logic;
//        knowledge as contextual;
//        knowledge as hierarchical;
//        intrinsicism and subjectivism as the two forms of rejecting objectivity;
/    5: Reason;
//        emotions as a product of ideas;
//        reason as man's only means of knowledge;
//        the arbitrary as neither true nor false;
//        certainty as contextual;
//        mysticism and skepticism as denials of reason;
/    6: Man;
//        living organisms as goal-directed and conditional;
//        reason as man's basic means of survival;
//        reason as an attribute of the individual;
/    7: The Good;
//        "life" as the essential root of "value";
//        man's life as the standard of moral value;
//        rationality as the primary virtue;
//        the individual as the proper beneficiary of his own moral action;
//        values as objective;
/    8: Virtue;
//        independence as a primary orientation to reality, not to other men;
//        integrity as loyalty to rational principles;
//        honesty as the rejection of unreality;
//        justice as rationality in the evaluation of men;
//        productiveness as the adjustment of nature to man;
//        pride as moral ambitiousness;
//        the initiation of physical force as evil;
/    9: Happiness;
//        virtue as practical;
//        happiness as the normal condition of man;
//        sex as metaphysical;
/    10: Government;
//        individual rights as absolutes;
//        government as an agency to protect rights;
//        statism as the politics of unreason;
/    11: Capitalism;
//        capitalism as the only moral social system;
//        capitalism as the system of objectivity;
//        opposition to capitalism as dependent on bad epistemology;
/    12: Art;
//        art as a concretization of metaphysics;
//        romantic literature as illustrating the role of philosophy in art;
//        esthetic value as objective;
