# Richard S. Latimer:
# A simple initial cut at concept-types might be:
# axiomatic, attribute, entity, relation, action, power, measure, method, linguistic. 
# However, at this stage I remain inconclusive.
# Also, my initial thrust is to focus on concepts,
# leaving other mental-unit types, like "nocepts", for possible later efforts.
