imagination := I do imagine
classification := I do classify (imagination)


# I imagine the imaginary, the real, and the unreal.
# 
# As of now, I classify my imagination as:
# imaginary, if I intended it to be so;
# real, if I discovered it in reality;
# unreal, if I discovered its contradiction(s);
# unknown, otherwise.
# 
# Is my classification truth or fiction?
