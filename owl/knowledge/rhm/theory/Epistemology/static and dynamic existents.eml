Food for thought

It seems reasonable to think of existents

    entity iss existent;

as having both a static nature

    entity has attribute;

and a dynamic nature (something happening in space,time) .

    at space=s,time=t {entity do action done;};

Dynamic seems very appropriate for living things,
which require some effort to continue their existence.

But what about a rock?  Is there anything inherently
dynamic about it?  Is it "doing something" to avoid
decaying into nothingness?  Maybe the perpetual motion
of its atoms?

I have said previously that

    entity do exist done;

suggesting that "exist" subsumes all "action".

But I'm now thinking "exist" is a "pseudo action"
which subsumes all characteristics.
Likewise, "characteristic" is a "pseudo attribute"
which subsumes all characteristics (maybe I'd better
start calling them properties).
And that's why 

    existence :: entity DO exist done;

is equivalent to (existence IS identity;)

    identity :: entity HAS characteristic;

They both denote the subsumption of all

    part
    attribute
    relation
    action
    interaction

of entity.
