	Consciousness is the faculty of awareness --
	the faculty of perceiving that which exists.


This definition gives us three equivalent ways of saying
the same thing:

	entity has consciousness
	entity has faculty = perceiving that which exists
	entity do perceive existent

I prefer the third way, because it describes an action
with an action, not an attribute.
