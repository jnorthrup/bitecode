To see whether my identification,

    an axiomatic concept is a proposition name

makes sense, one has only to ask "what are the referents of
a proposition name"?

To me, the answer is obvious. The referents of a proposition 
name are the referents of the proposition itself.  So

    Consciousness :: man has conscious;

says that the referents of "Consciousness" are all the
referents of "man has conscious", which is exactly
what Ayn Rand intended.

Of course, Rand would never have said it that way, 
because she choose not to study propositions.
