Most animals are considered agents, in most contexts; so are most organizations.   Most plants are not agents, in most contexts.  Inanimate devices are sometimes considered agents, in certain contexts.  This is one of those concepts which is important yet very hard to define precisely.  Here is some elaboration, to help convey the intended meaning of the basic criterion for agenthood:  It must seem that a kind of decision-making is going on, even if it's down at the `mindless' level of the reflex reaction of a spider leg to heat, or the reflex reaction of a Human Resources Department rejecting an applicant with no formal degree.  It generally `sounds right' or `feels  natural' to assign causality to agents, rather than some larger or smaller entity.  E.g., it is more natural to say `Fred wrote an essay' than to say `Fred's left hand wrote an essay' or, at the other extreme, to say `The Solar System wrote an essay'.  Similarly, we might very well talk about `Microsoft' buying IBM, but it would be unnatural and even incorrect to talk about a much larger entity (`corporate America') or smaller entity (`the Microsoft lawyers') as the performer of that buying action.")

(#$comment #$Artifact "A collection of tangible things.  An instance of #$Artifact is a tangible which was more or less intentionally created by an #$Agent (or a group of #$Agents working together) to serve some purpose or perform some function.  By `created', we don't require that the matter itself be created, it is often just the result of some sort of assemblage or modification process, such as a wooden flute that's been whittled from a tree branch, a sawhorse that's been put together out of boards and nails, a coin that's been minted by embossing or by melting liquid silver into a mold, etc.

Let's consider some positive and negative examples.

In addition to the obvious human artifacts (buildings, tools, textiles, power lines), this collection includes certain sorts of things made by #$Animals, such as bird nests, termite mounds, and beaver dams.

Something which just barely squeaks through the intended meaning of this concept is #$YaleUniversity.  In addition to the abstract legal entity, it consists of a set of physical buildings, furnishings, etc.  By contrast, an organization that had no headquarters building, equipment, tangible property, etc. would not be an artifact.  Similarly, a fictional character such as Tom Sawyer is not an artifact (in the context of the story, Tom is not an artifact because he is a real boy; in the context of the real world, Tom is not an artifact because he has no tangible component whatsoever.)

While some artifacts may be alive, or contain living subparts, we do not intend this collection to encompass all organisms which resulted from normal biological reproductive processes.  Your child is not an artifact.

If you do an oil painting of a house that is an artifact, but much more borderline is what you get if you take a rock and just paint it a solid color, say white.  In general that won't be an artifact unless it serves some purpose, such as marking the shoulder of a roadway, but more questionable cases are if the purpose of the white rock is just `to be sold as art' or `to look pretty.'  The white rock might thus be an artifact in certain contexts, but not in others.

Not every instance of #$Path-Generic (q.v.) is necessarily an instance of #$Artifact.  For example, some channels used for navigation may not be artifacts, because even though they are marked with human artifacts (i.e., channel markers) as locations where ships may safely travel, the channel itself may have been a naturally occurring pre-existing thing -- e.g., the #$EnglishChannel.  If a #$Channel-WideStrait were produced or maintained only by constant dredging, it might count as an artifact.  By contrast, each #$Canal, such as #$SuezCanal, is almost certain to be an #$Artifact.")
