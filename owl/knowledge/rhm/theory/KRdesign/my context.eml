Suppose I make the statement

    I saw Bob Hope in person at the Presidio.

What is the context of my statement?  Quite literally,
it is everything I know.

    at space=3Dhere, time=3Dnow, view=3DDick McCullough knows {
        I saw Bob Hope in person at the Presidio
    }

How can you understand what I said?
Because your context is everything you know,
and our contexts have a lot in common.

    at space=3Dthere, time=3Dnow, view=3Dyou know {
        Dick McCullough saw Bob Hope in person at the Presidio
    }

Note:
For this example, I'm leaving out the extra layer of context

    at view=3DDick McCullough says { ... }


From the viewpoint of knowledge representation, capturing
everything I know is a difficult problem.  What can we do
to simplify that problem?  I see two promising approaches.

1. We can use genus-differentia definitions to condense the
knowledge.

    at view=3DDick McCullough definitions { ... }

2. We can select only those definitions that are relevant to
the words in my statement.

    at view=3Drelevant Dick McCullough definitions { ... }

In theory, these are common-sense, reasonable approaches;
in practice, they need to be tested.
