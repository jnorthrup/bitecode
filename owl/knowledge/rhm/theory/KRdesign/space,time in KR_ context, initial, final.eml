1. general context=20
The basic KR proposition has the form=20
    at context { statement }=20
Including space,time in context permits making statements which isolate =
& focus on space-time-independent properties.  Some statements are =
space-time-dependent.  The distinction is important because =
space-time-independent statements have wider implications.=20
Example statements:=20
a. Jane has sex=3Dfemale=20
b. Jane isa person=20
c. John do walk with a limp done=20
d. John do walk to the store done=20
a and b are attribute and relation statements which are independent of =
space-time.=20
c is an action statement which is independent of space-time.=20
d is an action statement which depends on space-time.=20

2. action initial and final characteristics=20
The fundamental characteristics of all actions are:=20
a. they change the properties of existents;=20
b. they are performed by an entity.=20
KR specifies the changes by a set of initial characteristics which exist =
before the action, and a set of final characteristics which exist after =
the action.  Initial and final characteristics may include space-time.=20
Example statements:=20
c. water do change from temperature=3Dpositive to temperature=3D0 done =
causes water do change from phase=3Dliquid to phase=3Dsolid done=20
d. John do walk from his house to the store done=20
c is a causality statement which is independent of space-time.=20
d is an action statement which depends on space-time.=20

3. action contexts=20
space,time specifies where,when an action occurs.  Typically, they =
specify the initial space,time of the action.  For some actions, they =
specify the final space,time.=20
Example propositions:=20
a. at 8 am { John do go to the store done }=20
b. at 5 pm { John do finish od work done }=20
a is a proposition with a context specifying the initiation of an =
action.=20
b is a proposition with a context specifying the completion of an =
action.=20
