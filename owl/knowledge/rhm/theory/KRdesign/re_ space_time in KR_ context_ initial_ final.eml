You make some excellent points.

1. My concept of "person" does not depend on legal status (e.g. age).

2. My concept of "time independent" is related to causality.
I view attributes (e.g. sex) as "constant", unless/until changed by some =
action (e.g. sex change operation).
In other words, there is a "long time interval" where we can view the =
attribute as "time independent".
I think this is a good way to characterize reality,
even though "long time interval" depends on the judgment of the =
"observer".

In summary:
    an attribute is a space-time-independent characteristic of an entity
    an action is a space-time-dependent characteristic of an entity
    actions change attributes

  Belated comments.

    a. Jane has sex=3Dfemale=20
    b. Jane isa person=20
    c. John do walk with a limp done=20
    d. John do walk to the store done=20
    a and b are attribute and relation statements which are independent =
of space-time.=20

    GR> a is not independent if Jane has a sex change. If your datastore =
was for a sex-change clinic it would be the most significant variable. =
In some jurisdictions sex changes are not recognized (I understand from =
this week's newspapers that in the UK it will be possible in future to =
change your birth certificate) so this statement is both space and time =
dependent.

    b is space-time dependent according to your definition of "person". =
If it is a legal definition then in many jurisdictions it will be true =
only after one of Jane's birthdays, and which one will vary from place =
to place.

    c is an action statement which is independent of space-time.=20

    GR> c is not time independent. Presumably Jane wasn't born walking, =
so it is not true until at least the time at which she could walk. After =
that it depends on whether the limp was genetic or acquired. She will =
also only walk with a limp in appropriate environments (eg not under =
water or if she is an astronaut).

    d is an action statement which depends on space-time.=20

    GR> ...as are all the rest. In any case they are bounded by Jane's =
life: and that may have begun at conception or at birth, or any time =
between or even before, according to your religious or philosophical =
conjecture, or the requirements of your datastore.=20

    Any definition of space-time independence is itself space-time =
dependent, and dependent on the view of the domain within which, or the =
authority by which, it is expressed.  (But then again, that's just my =
point of view...:-)

    I dont disagree with your general approach to contexts, btw Richard: =
it is quite similar to the one we use, but beware of making =
non-contextual statements about them as they undermine its credibility =
and usefulness.
