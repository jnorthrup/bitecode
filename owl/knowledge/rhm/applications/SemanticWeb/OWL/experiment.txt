are xmlns qualifiers necessary?

I have been thinking about ways to avoid using xmlns qualifiers,
in order to improve readability of RDF/OWL files.

I expect that many practical cases will have unique names
without using qualifiers.  To test this idea, I have added
two experimental features to MKE (http://rhm.cdepot.net/).
1. make q:name the same as name, for all q
2. check command option to detect multiple q for a name

Here is an illustration of these features.
