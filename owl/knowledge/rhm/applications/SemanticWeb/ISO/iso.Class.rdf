            DEFINITION A Class is a Thing that is an understanding of the nature of
            things and that divides things into those which are members of the class and
            those which are not according to one or more criteria.
            The identity of a Class is ultimately defined by its members. No two classes
            have the same membership. However, a distinction must be made between a Class
            having members, and those members being known, so within an information
            system the members recorded may change over time, even though the true
            membership does not change.

            NOTE The membership of a Class is unchanging as a result of the
            spatio-temporal paradigm upon which this schema is based. In another paradigm
            it might be stated that a car is red at one time, and green at another time,
            indicating that the class of red things and class of green things changed
            members. However, using a spatio-temporal paradigm, a temporal part, state 1,
            of the car is red, and another temporal part of the car, state 2, is green.
            In this way the members of the classes red and green are unchanging. The same
            principle applies to future temporal parts as to past temporal parts, it is
            just more likely that the membership of these is not known.

            NOTE A class may be a member of another class or itself.

        <rdfs:comment>
            NOTE The set theory that applies to classes in this model is non-wellfounded
            set theory (see: ACZEL, Peter. Non-Well-Founded Sets, Center for the Study of
            Language and Information, Stanford, California, 1988, ISBN 0937073229).
            This permits statements like "class is a member of class", unlike traditional
            set theories such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory found in standard texts
            (see: ITҬ K. (editor). Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics, Mathematical
            Society of Japan, Edition 2, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1993,
            ISBN 0262590204)

            NOTE There is a null Class that has no members. Although there is only one
            Class that has no members, there can be a Class that has no members in the
            actual world, but which does have members in other possible worlds.
