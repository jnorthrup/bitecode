Okay, folks, here's the scoop.
I read [1] carefully, and concluded that Tim's definition of context is essentially the same as mine.  Despite the fact that [1] says
    "Context is the relationship between a statement and the formula it is directly part of."
the examples and discussion indicate that
    The context of a statement is the (sub)formula that is necessary to understand its meaning.
Note that the (sub)formula does not include the statement, and may be part of some enclosing context which is physically separated from the statement.  In rare cases, such as axiomatic concepts or inter-dependent concepts, the statement may be part of its own context.  Since the context of a statement logically precedes it, it is to be expected that the order of statements is important.

The rest of this email displays the KR version of the "Anonymous nodes" and "Formulae" examples from [1].  If you don't understand the KR version, ask me for clarification or consult [2],[3].

"Anonymous nodes" example
    at view = doc {
        forSome g1 isa person {
            forSome g2 isa book {
                $g1 has firstname = "Ora";
                $g2 has title = "Moby Dick";
                at time = past { $g1 do write od $g2 done }
            } # end forSome g2
        } # end forSome g1
    } # end view = doc

"Formulae" example
    at view = doc {
        forSome c1 isa view {
            at view = $c1 {
                forSome g1 isa person {
                    forSome g2 isa book {
                        $g1 has firstname = "Ora";
                        $g2 has title = "Moby Dick";
                        at time = past { $g1 do write od $g2 done }
                    } # end forSome g2
                } # end forSome g1
        } # end view = $c1
        $c1 has type = falsehood
    } # end view = doc

  As I am yours.   The term has been much abused (and I don't excuse myself).

  Because it's working software, Notation 3 is probably a useful common 
  ground, with its notions of formulae (roughly: collections of statements) 
  and context "Context is the relationship between a statement and the 
  formula it is directly part of" [1].

  I don't fully understand the last bit, but the idea of context as a 
  relationship rather than a thing seems to sidestep the discussion of 
  forward/backward view of these things.
